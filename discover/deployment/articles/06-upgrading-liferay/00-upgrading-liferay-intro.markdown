# Upgrading to @product@ [](id=upgrading-to-liferay-7)

Upgrading to @product@ consists of two steps: upgrading your installation and
then upgrading the database. @product@ can be upgraded using a straightforward
process. To upgrade to the latest release directly, you must be coming from
Liferay Portal 6.0.12 or higher.

If you're on Liferay Portal 6.0.11 or below, you should upgrade to Liferay Portal 6.2 before
approaching an upgrade to the @product-ver@ platform. Please see the
[Upgrading to Liferay Portal 6.2](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/upgrading-liferay)
article for information on upgrading to Liferay Portal 6.2 first.

Before you do anything, however, you should follow a pre-upgrade process of
cleaning and normalizing your data. After that, you can prepare your system for
the upgrade, and then finally run the upgrade process. 

The tutorials that follow lead you through those steps.
