# Managing Apps [](id=managing-apps)

Apps are the central focus of the Liferay experience. For example, Liferay's web 
experience management, collaboration, and business productivity features all 
consist of apps. Even the Control Panel consists of apps that let you configure 
Liferay to your liking. You can also add to or change Liferay's built-in 
functionality by installing other apps. Naturally, Liferay provides several ways 
to manage, find, and install apps. This section covers these topics, and more,
