# Managing Documents and Media [](id=managing-documents-and-media)

@product@'s Documents and Media library provides a mechanism for storing files
online using the same type of structure that you use to store files locally. You
can use it to store files of any kind; it serves as a virtual shared drive, and
can mount and browse external repositories. Its companion app, the Media
Gallery, displays selected content from the Documents and Media library. It can
display image, audio, and video files. Other features in the Documents and Media
library include customizable document types and metadata sets, automatic
document preview generation, and support for mounting multiple external
repositories.

Liferay Sync synchronizes your local copies of the Documents and Media libraries
with your site's libraries. It lets you manage files from your desktop machine
and mobile device. It provides the best way to manage your files on all your
devices.
