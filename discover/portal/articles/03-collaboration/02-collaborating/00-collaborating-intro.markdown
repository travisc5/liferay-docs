# Collaborating [](id=collaborating)

@product@ ships with a robust suite of collaboration applications that you
can use to build communities of users for your site. These applications provide
all the features that you would expect of standalone applications outside a
portal setting. The difference with Liferay's collaboration apps, however, is
that they all share a common look and feel, security model, and architecture.
They inherit the strengths of being part of Liferay's development platform so
you can use them in combination with @product@'s user management and
content management features to build a well-integrated, feature-rich website.

learn how to set up and administer
