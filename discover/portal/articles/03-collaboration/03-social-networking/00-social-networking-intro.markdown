# Creating A Social Network [](id=creating-a-social-network)

Since the first social networks rose to popularity, concepts such as
*Friend* and later *Like*--previously reserved for direct human
interaction--have taken on new meaning in an always-online, information
driven culture. It could be argued that social networks have transformed
the way people interact with their friends, relatives and colleagues. 
Friends, connections, followers, circles, and lists have enabled people to
connect and stay connected in ways they'd never been able to before.
Many organizations are now realizing the importance of leveraging social
interactions for more than just recreation. Liferay's robust social
features make it a great platform for business web sites, casual web sites
and everything in between.

Liferay's social applications ship with the product, but they only scratch the
surface of what's available on the platform. For example, these applications let
you connect your users as Friends, but the API allows for all kinds of
relationships, such as coworker, spouse, child, follower, romantic partner, and
more. If you want to take advantage of some of these other relationships, your
developers can use these apps as a starting point for implementing the full
power of Liferay's social platform. 

Out of the box, Liferay has a constantly improving set of social features that
help you encourage social interactions on your own website as well as leverage
the power and popularity of other social networks. In this chapter, you'll learn
about

- General use social portlets

- How to connect users using Liferay social relations

When you're finished, you'll be well equipped to use Liferay to power your social
network.
