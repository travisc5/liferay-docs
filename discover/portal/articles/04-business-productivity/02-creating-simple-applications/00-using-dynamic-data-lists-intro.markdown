# Creating Simple Applications [](id=creating-simple-applications)

Business needs change, and technology must adapt to meet those needs. Things
that used to be done using manual processes are now done electronically. You
may want your team to sign up on your web site for a holiday party. Maybe you
need to put up a job posting board every fall, where only administrators can
create new job posts. Maybe you'd like users to manage a notebook or To-Do list
on their private pages. In these cases, you need custom sets of data, and your
users need to add and access their information. 

In the past, you'd need to be a developer to accomplish any of this. Today, you
can do it without writing a single line of code. Liferay's *Dynamic Data Lists*
application provides an easy way to create, aggregate, and display new data
types. Data Lists are flexible enough to handle all types of data, and you
don't have to write any code. Simply put, Liferay gives you the power to perform
the following actions:

- Create new lists from data definitions you build yourself

- Create new lists from predefined definitions

- Customize the input forms for ease of use

- Customize the output format

<!--- Integrate lists into Workflow -->

All of this capability is summarized in two concepts: data defining
and data displaying. These data lists are dynamic for a reason: they are
flexible and powerful. From collecting simple input from the user ("Did you find
what you were looking for?") to developing an entire data entry system for real
estate listings, Dynamic Data Lists have your use case covered. Combined with
the flexibility provided through templates and the power of languages like
FreeMarker, entire applications can be built in a short time.
