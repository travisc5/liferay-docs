# Publishing Content Dynamically [](id=publishing-content-dynamically)

Any type of content in @product@ is considered an asset. In the 
[Creating Web Content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-web-content)
chapter, you examined @product@'s most common type of asset: web content. Other
types of assets include blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts,
bookmarks, and documents. It's possible for developers to define custom asset
types that utilize @product@'s asset framework. Originally, the asset framework
was created to provide a mechanism for adding tags to blog entries, wiki
articles, and web content without reimplementing the same functionality multiple
times. The asset framework has been greatly extended since then and it now
supports tags, categories, vocabularies, comments, ratings, and asset
relationships.

The Asset Publisher application is designed to display multiple assets. It has
quite a few configuration options which you'll cover in this chapter. By
default, abstracts (previews) of recently published assets are displayed by the
Asset Publisher app and links to their full views are provided. You can
configure the Asset Publisher app to display a table of assets, a list of asset
titles, or the full content of assets. You can also configure the Asset
Publisher to display only certain kinds of assets and you choose how many items
to display in a list. The Asset Publisher app is very useful for displaying
chosen types of content, for displaying recent content, and for allowing users
to browse content by tags and categories. The Asset Publisher is designed to
integrate with the Tags Navigation and Categories Navigation apps to allow this.

This chapter covers the following topics:

- Tagging and categorizing content
- Using targeted, single value, and multi-value vocabularies
- Adding relationships between assets
- Geolocating assets
- Using faceted search
- Publishing assets
- Publishing RSS feeds
- Restoring deleted assets

The first thing you'll learn about is tagging and categorizing content.
