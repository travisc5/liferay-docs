# Web Experience Management [](id=web-experience-management)

**Experience**; consider that word for a moment. Not the type of experience you
gain with repetition, but the contact or encounter you have with something. For
example, if you're hiking in the woods and are mauled by a black panther, you
would consider this a *bad* hiking experience. Suppose you travel to your local
food market and someone gives you a large amount of money for no reason other
than to be nice. You would consider this a *great* grocery shopping experience.

These two examples may be a bit extreme, so let's tone this down to something a
little more practical. Suppose you're a huge sports fan and you're contemplating
whether to buy tickets to the big game next week. What are some of the things
you might consider that would determine whether you attend the game or not? The
*price* of the tickets is usually the most important factor. Others may include
parking accessibility, distance to the game, quality of your favorite team,
and other factors. To determine whether you attend the game, you weigh the
negative factors, like price and the stadium's nightmarish parking setup, with
the reason you're attending the game, the *experience*. If you expect the
experience of seeing your favorite team play to trump the negative factors, you'll
attend. If you expect the experience will be bad or worse than the negative
factors you expect to encounter, you'll stay home and watch the game on TV.

@product@ takes the *experience* factor very seriously when it comes to web
management. Just like the sports fan that weighs the experience vs. the live
game headaches, the user/administrator also weighs the experience of using a web
platform with the resulting site created on it. With the apps and features
provided with @product@'s Web Experience Management suite, the management of
sites, pages, and content is seamless.

Managing sites and pages is a fundamental pillar of any web site, and @product@
provides easy-to-use features that make site/page creation quick and easy. Web
Content is another building block upon which most sites rely. With Liferay's web
content apps, you can easily create simple or complex content for your site's
visitors. Once you've created content, @product@ also provides several innovative
ways to publish that content, so users can find the right information as fast as
possible.  Sometimes your site must adapt on the fly, whether it be for
different holidays or events.  A testing environment where you can plan the look
and feel of your pages/content gives you peace of mind in knowing that you won't
have to trial and error site changes on a live page.

Just as the die-hard fan knew he'd have a great experience when buying his
tickets to the big game, you can expect a great and seamless web experience with
@product@.
