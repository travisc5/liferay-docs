# Starting Site Development [](id=starting-site-development)

A site is a set of pages that can be used to publish content or applications.
Sites can be independent or they can be associated with an organization and
serve as the website for that organization. With @product@, you can create as
many different sites as you like within the context of a single Liferay instance.

You can use sites in @product@ to build many different kinds of websites.
Whether you're building a large corporate website, a company intranet, or a
small site designed to facilitate collaboration among team members, Liferay's
framework provides all the tools you need.

You'll begin your journey with a tour of @product@'s user interface. Next,
you'll create a custom Lunar Resort Example instance and explore ways to create
sites and pages for that Liferay instance. There are many different ways to
manage your sites and pages, which is also covered. To begin site development
with @product@, continue on to the next section.
