# Creating Teams for Advanced Site Membership Management [](id=creating-teams-for-advanced-site-membership-management)

If you have an ad hoc group of users who perform the same set of tasks in a
site, you can organize them into Site Teams. Site administrators can assign
these team's permissions for various site-specific functions. Site Teams are the
preferred method for collecting permissions within a single site. Some common
functions to assign a Site Team include:

- Moderating site Wiki content
- Managing Message Boards threads
- Writing blogs
- Editing a specific page in the site

For instance, if your site has Message Boards, you might want to enable a subset
of the site's members to moderate the categories and threads, and perhaps to ban
abusive/offensive posters. To do this, you could create a Site Team named
*Lunar Resort Message Board Moderators*, define the team's permissions in the
Message Boards application, and assign the desired site members to the team. 

The permissions assigned to a Site Team only apply to that site. Knowing that
a team's permissions don't impact other sites, site administrators can
concentrate on defining and applying permissions to their sites' teams.

**Note:** To create and apply permissions for a group of users to use across
multiple sites or organizations in your Liferay instance, consider aggregating
the users into a [User Group](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/user-groups)
and assigning the User Group permissions via
[Roles](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/roles-and-permissions).

To create a team within a site, first navigate to the Site Administration page
of your site and select *Members* &rarr; *Site Teams*. It's important to note that
configuring other site membership groupings, such as *Users*, *Organizations*,
and *User Groups* can be done in the *Site Memberships* app, which is also
located in the Members tab. You can visit the 
[User Management](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/user-management)
chapter for more information on how these site memberships work. Finally, click
the *Add Team* icon (![Add Team](../../../images/icon-add.png)).

After you've clicked the *Add Team* button and entered a name and a description,
click *Save*. Your new team shows in the list. To add members, click on the
team name link and then select *Add Team Members*.

To manage a team's permissions, click on the *Actions* icon
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Permissions* for that
team. Setting permissions for the team assigns all of the team's members those
permissions. Only administrators with the ability to edit/manage the team have
the ability to manage team permissions.

If you created a team whose task is to moderate the Message Boards, for example,
you'd want to give the team all the permissions they'd need. To do this, 
navigate to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Message Boards*
and select *Permissions* from the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the top right of the screen. Find
the team in the Role column, and select the appropriate permissions.

That's it! It's easy to give groups of site users appropriate permissions to
perform their tasks. This chapter has provided an introduction to @product@ site
management. Youâ€™ve learned how to use @product@ to create multiple sites with
different membership types. You've also seen how easy it is to create and manage
sites and to create and manage pages within a site in @product@. Next, you'll
begin working with web content.
