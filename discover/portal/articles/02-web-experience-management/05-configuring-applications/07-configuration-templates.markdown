# Configuration Templates [](id=configuration-templates)

Once you've configured an application, Configuration Templates enable you to
save those settings in a reusable template. If someone goes in and changes the
settings of a particular app, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back
to the original configuration template. Configuration templates are only
available for apps placed on a page. Applications available from the Menu do not
provide configuration templates.

To create a configuration template, click the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the menu in the app's title
bar and select *Configuration Templates*. If the current settings of the app
you're configuring are the ones you want to save, click the *Save Current
Configuration as Template* button. If not, change the settings of your app until
it's configured the way you want it, and then click the button.

There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click
*Save*. You should now see your configuration in the list. If you ever need to revert
the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions*
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the
configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the apps in @product@ support this feature. This is
particularly useful for apps that have a lot of configuration options, such as
the Message Boards application. 

In this chapter, you've explored the configuration options available for Liferay
applications. You learned how to customize your applications, export/import app
data, communicate between apps, take advantage of different scopes, and save
your app's configuration settings. You also examined the different uses of
social applications like Facebook and Netvibes for your Liferay applications. In
all, @product@ gives you an abundance of options to leverage the full capability
of your applications.
