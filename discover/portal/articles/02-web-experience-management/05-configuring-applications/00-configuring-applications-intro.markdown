# Configuring Applications [](id=configuring-applications)

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
applications that ship with @product@ also share common features. These include
look and feel, exporting/importing app data, communication, sharing,
permissions, scoping, and configuration templates. You'll learn how these
features work together to facilitate information flow within @product@ and provide
an enhanced experience for your users. So before you get into the nitty gritty
of the applications themselves, it's best to cover these common features first,
starting with the look and feel configuration options.
