# Application Permissions [](id=application-permissions)

All of Liferay's apps support @product@'s robust, fine-grained permissions
system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in the permissions tab
of the app's configuration dialog box. You can grant roles permission to:

- Add a display template
- Add the app to a page
- Configure the app
- Modify the app's permissions
- Modify the app's preferences
- View the app

To set these permissions, go to the app's *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) and click select *Permissions*.
This shows you a table of roles defined in the Liferay instance. Use the check
boxes to grant certain permissions to different roles. Click *Save* after you've
made your selections.

Beyond this, specific permissions are generally defined for specific
applications. For example, the Message Boards application contains a *Ban User*
permission. This makes no sense in the context of another app, say, the Blogs
application. You'll go over permissions for specific applications in the
sections for those applications. Next, you'll explore how to sharing
applications.
