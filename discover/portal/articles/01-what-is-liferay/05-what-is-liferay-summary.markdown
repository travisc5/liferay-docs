# Summary [](id=summary)

So what is Liferay? As you can see, it's hard to describe, because it does so
much. What we've essentially done is say it's a totally awesome content and
document managing, user collaborating, socially enabling, application
developing, corporate integrating, completely customizable platform for building
the Internet. If we'd said that up front, you'd probably have doubted us.
Hopefully now, you can see that it's true.

here.
