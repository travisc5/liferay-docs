# Using Liferay as a web platform [](id=using-liferay-as-a-web-platform)

We can't even begin to imagine what you're thinking of building, but whatever it
is, you're going to put your heart and soul into it. Building it on Liferay's
web platform can give you a leg up. It provides everything you need to support
your application, so you can concentrate solely on what *you're* building, and
not the rest of the features your users expect to come along with it. 

Imagine your application for a moment. Does it require users to register on
your site? Can users comment on content contained in your application? Is there
something that users can tag or categorize? If you think about the layout of
the application, would it benefit from modularization? Could you make use of a
rich JavaScript framework with many components built into it?  How about
security--will you need to make information available to some users, but not to
all users? @product@ has all of this and more available to developers. 

@product@'s development framework is a great help when you're building an
application for the web, for mobile, or for anything in between. For example,
bug fixes to your applications are easy to apply, because Liferay applications
are hot deployed to the running server. Liferay's Marketplace gives you a
ready-made shopping center for your applications. And Liferay's web services and
JSON architecture make it easy for you to share data from your applications with
other systems running on different platforms. 

You get all this and much more. It's a very powerful platform, and certainly
worth your investigation. Read the developer section of this site to learn more.

## A great integration platform [](id=a-great-integration-platform)

If you're building an enterprise system, portals were designed in the first
place to be a single point of entry to your users' applications and content.
Since @product@ integrates well with user directories such as LDAP and
Active Directory, along with single sign-on systems such as SAML and OpenSSO, it
fits well into your enterprise systems. This allows you to use it as an
integration platform for existing applications. 

@product@, since it adheres to the JSR standard for portlets, was designed
from the ground up for application integration. You can add any application
installed on the system to any page in the portal. You can make use of APIs
provided by other systems to integrate their data into an application window in
Liferay. And applications you create with Liferay's Service Builder framework
are web service-enabled from the start. 

## Hosting multiple sites on @product@ [](id=hosting-multiple-sites-on-liferay-portal)

@product@ excels as a multi-site hosting platform. You can use it to host
multiple sites under the same overall architecture, or you could host several
completely different websites based solely on Liferay's ability to serve
multiple instances of itself from the same physical installation. 

In the first scenario, @product@'s Sites architecture lets you create
multiple, different websites that have public and/or private sets of pages and
as many pages within those sets as you'd like. Users can join and leave open
sites with one click. Alternatively, sites can be defined as restricted or
private, and users can't access those unless they're added by site
administrators. All these sites can have canonical domain names such as
baseballcards.liferay.com or progrock.liferay.com. 

Using this construct, you can build anything you can imagine. There is no limit
to the number of sites you can have: some Liferay installations have only one or
two, but others have many thousands. For those larger installations, @product@
contains a complete site membership management framework that lets
administrators manage automatic site members for groups of users. It really is
built to scale to the size you need. 

In the second scenario, @product@ lets you create completely separate
instances of itself from the same installation. Users, groups, organizations,
sites, and roles from each instance are kept completely separate. If a user
registers for a user id on one instance, he or she would have to register as a
new user on one of the other instances. 

This lets you host many different, separate websites from one @product@
installation. Users of each instance have access to the same powerful content
management, collaboration, social, and web development platform that they'd have
if they were operating from a single, standalone installation.

Let's see how you can customize @product@ so that it looks and operates
exactly the way you've envisioned for your site.
