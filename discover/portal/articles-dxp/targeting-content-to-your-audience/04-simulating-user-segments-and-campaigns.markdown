# Simulating User Segments and Campaigns [](id=simulating-user-segments-and-campaigns)

The Audience Targeting app includes a simulator feature. The Audience Targeting
Simulator allows administrators to preview the way portal pages appear to
different users. It does so by allowing site administrators to modify the
matched user segments. The Audience Targeting Simulator is accessible via the
*Simulation* icon (![Simulation](../../images-dxp/icon-simulation.png)) in the
top Control Menu. Clicking on the Simulator icon opens the right-side panel
which displays a tab related to Audience Targeting: *User Segments*. By default,
the Audience Targeting Simulator is only visible to site administrators and
users with the View permission for the Audience Targeting Simulator.

defining permissions for a role, go to *Site Administration* &rarr;
*Configuration* to find the *Audience Targeting* section.

The User Segments tab of the Audience Targeting simulator displays a list of all
the user segments available for the site. You can select or deselect any user
segment. This allows site administrators to simulate how the website would
appear to different users. Clicking on a user segment makes your website appear
to you the way it would appear to that selected user segment. This allows site
administrators to navigate around their site as if they were a user that matched
the selected user segments.
