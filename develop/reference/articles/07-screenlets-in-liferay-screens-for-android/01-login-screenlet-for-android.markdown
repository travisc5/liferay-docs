# Login Screenlet for Android [](id=loginscreenlet-for-android)

## Requirements [](id=requirements)

- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 15) or above
- Liferay Portal 6.2 (CE or EE), Liferay 7.0 CE, Liferay DXP
- OAuth Provider app (OAuth authentication is optional. Note that OAuth only 
  works with Liferay EE and DXP instances).

## Compatibility [](id=compatibility)

- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 15) and above

## Features [](id=features)

Login Screenlet lets you authenticate portal users in your Android app. The 
following types of authentication are supported:

- **Basic:** uses user login and password according to 
  [HTTP Basic Access Authentication specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617). 
  Depending on the authentication method used by your Liferay instance, you need 
  to provide the user's email address, screen name, or user ID. You also need to 
  provide the user's password. 

- **OAuth:** implements the 
  [OAuth 1.0a specification](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/). 

- **Cookie:** uses a cookie to log in. This lets you access documents and images 
  in the portal's document library without the guest view permission in the 
  portal. The other authentication types require this permission to access such 
  files. 

For instructions on configuring the Screenlet to use these authentication types, 
see the below 
[Portal Configuration](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/loginscreenlet-for-android#portal-configuration) 
and 
[Screenlet Attributes](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/loginscreenlet-for-android#attributes) 
sections. 

When a user successfully authenticates, their user attributes are retrieved for 
use in the app. You can use the `SessionContext` class to get the current user's 
attributes. 

Note that user credentials and attributes can be stored in an app's data store 
(see the `saveCredentials` attribute). Android's `SharedPreferences` is 
currently the only data store implemented. However, new and more secure data 
stores will be added in the future. Stored user credentials can be used to 
automatically log the user in to subsequent sessions. To do this, you can use 
the method `SessionContext.loadStoredCredentials()`.

## Portal Configuration [](id=portal-configuration)

### Basic Authentication [](id=basic-authentication)

Before using Login Screenlet, you should make sure your portal is configured 
with the authentication option you want to use. You can choose email address, 
screen name, or user ID. You can set this in the Control Panel by selecting 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, and then selecting the 
*Authentication* section. The authentication options are in the *How do users 
authenticate?* selector menu.

For more details, see the 
[Setting up a Liferay Instance](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/setting-up-a-liferay-instance) 
section of the User Guide. 

### OAuth Authentication [](id=oauth-authentication)

+$$$

**Note:** OAuth authentication is only available in Liferay DXP instances.

To use OAuth authentication, first install the OAuth provider app from the 
Liferay Marketplace. 
[Click here](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/45261909) 
to get this app. Once it's installed, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* 
&rarr; *OAuth Admin*, and add a new application to be used from Liferay Screens. 
Once the application exists, copy the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* 
values for later use in Login Screenlet. 

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet doesn't support offline mode. It requires network connectivity.
If you need to log in users automatically, even when there's no network 
connection, you can use the `credentialsStorage` attribute together with the 
`SessionContext.loadStoredCredentials` method. 

## Required Attributes [](id=required-attributes)

- None

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The ID of the View's layout. You can set this attribute to `@layout/login_default` (Default View) or `@layout/login_material` (Material View). To use the Material View, you must first install the Material View Set. [Click here](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-views-in-android-screenlets) for instructions on installing and using Views and View Sets, including the Material View Set. |
| `companyId` | `number` | The ID of the portal instance to authenticate to. If you don't set this attribute or set it to `0`, the Screenlet uses the `companyId` setting in `LiferayServerContext`. |
| `loginMode` | `enum` | The Screenlet's authentication type. You can set this attribute to `basic`, `oauth`, or `cookie`. If you don't set this attribute, the Screenlet defaults to basic authentication. |
| `basicAuthMethod` | `string` | Specifies the basic authentication option to use. You can set this attribute to `email`, `screenName` or `userId`. This must match the server's authentication option. If you don't set this attribute, and don't set the `loginMode` attribute to `oauth` or `cookie`, the Screenlet defaults to basic authentication with the `email` option. |
| `OAuthConsumerKey` | `string` | Specifies the *Consumer Key* to use in OAuth authentication. |
| `OAuthConsumerSecret` | `string` | Specifies the *Consumer Secret* to use in OAuth authentication. |
| `credentialsStorage ` | `enum` | Sets the mode for storing user credentials. The possible values are `none`, `auto`, and `shared_preferences`. If set to `shared_preferences`, the user credentials and attributes are stored using Android's `SharedPreferences` class. If set to `none`, user credentials and attributes aren't saved at all. If set to `auto`, the best of the available storage modes is used. Currently, this is equivalent to `shared_preferences`. The default value is `none`. |

## Listener [](id=listener)

The Login Screenlet delegates some events to an object that implements the 
`LoginListener` interface. This interface let you implement the following 
methods:

- `onLoginSuccess(User user)`: Called when login successfully completes. The 
  `user` parameter contains a set of the logged in user's attributes. The 
  supported keys are the same as those in the 
  [portal's User entity](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service.xml#L2575-L2737).

- `onLoginFailure(Exception e)`: Called when an error occurs in the process.
