# Model Listener [](id=model-listener)

## What does this sample do when it's deployed? [](id=what-does-this-sample-do-when-its-deployed)

The Model Listener sample demonstrates adding a custom model listener to a
Liferay Portal out-of-the-box entity. When deploying this sample with no
customizations, a custom model listener is added to the portal's layouts,
listening for `onBeforeCreate` events. This means that any page creation will
trigger this listener, which will execute before the new page is created.

For example, if a new page is added with the name *My Test Page*, the following
message is printed to the console:

![Figure 1: The sample model listener's message in the console.](../../../images/model-listener-1.png)

You can also verify that the  model listener sample was executed by navigating
to the new page's *Configure Page* &rarr; *SEO* option. The HTML Title field
looks like this:

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample leverages the
[ModelListener](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/model/ModelListener.html)
extension point.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

Model Listeners are used to listen for persistence events on models and take
actions as a result of those events. Actions can be executed on an entity's
database table before or after a `create`, `remove`, `update`, `addAssociation`,
or `removeAssociation` event. It's possible to have more than one model listener
on a single model too; the execution order is not guaranteed.

There are two steps to create a new model listener:

- Implement a Model Listener class
- Register the new service in Liferay's OSGi runtime

This sample adds the model listener logic in a new Java class named
`CustomLayoutListener` that extends
[BaseModelListener](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/model/BaseModelListener.html).

    public class CustomLayoutListener extends BaseModelListener<Layout> {

        @Override
        public void onBeforeCreate(Layout model) throws ModelListenerException {
            System.out.println(
                "About to create layout: " + model.getNameCurrentValue());

            model.setTitle("Title generated by model listener!");
        }

    }

Important things to note in this code snippet are

- The entity to be targeted by this model listener is specified as the
  parameterized type (e.g., `Layout`).
- The overridden methods dictate the type of event(s) that are listened for
  (e.g., `onBeforeCreate`); they also trigger the logic execution.

The final step is registering the service in Liferay's OSGi runtime, which is
accomplished by the following annotation (if using Declarative Services):

    @Component(immediate = true, service = ModelListener.class)
