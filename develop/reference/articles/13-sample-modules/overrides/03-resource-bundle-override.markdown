# Resource Bundle Override [](id=resource-bundle-override)

The Resource Bundle Override sample conveys the recommended approach to override
an application's language keys file for any module that is deployed to Liferay
Portal's OSGi runtime (not applicable to Liferay Portal's core language keys).

This example overrides the default `add-blog-entry` language key (English and
Spanish) for Portal's default Blogs application. After deploying this sample
hook to Portal, the Blogs application's *Add Blog Entry* button is modified to
display *Overriden Add Blog Entry*. If you change the Portal's default language
to Spanish, the modified language key is translated to display in that language.
For example, the text changes to *AÃ±adir entrada sobreescrita*.

For reference, the Blogs application's language keys are stored in the
[liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal) Github repo's
`modules/apps/collaboration/blogs/blogs-web/src/main/resources/content` folder.

The steps to override applications' language keys are

- Implement a resource bundle loader.
- Register the service.
- Provide the new language keys that will override the original ones.

The resource bundle loader is a class that should implement the interface
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.ResourceBundleLoader`. Specifically, you must
implement the `loadResourceBundle` method, which returns the loaded resource
bundle:

    @Override
    public ResourceBundle loadResourceBundle(String languageId) {
        return _resourceBundleLoader.loadResourceBundle(languageId);
    }

Then you must set the resource bundle loader to load the resource bundles as an
`AggregateResourceBundleLoader`.

    @Reference(target = "(&(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web)(!(component.name=com.liferay.blade.samples.hook.resourcebundle.ResourceBundleLoaderComponent)))")
    public void setResourceBundleLoader(
        ResourceBundleLoader resourceBundleLoader) {

        _resourceBundleLoader = new AggregateResourceBundleLoader(
            new CacheResourceBundleLoader(
                new ClassResourceBundleLoader(
                    "content.Language",
                    ResourceBundleLoaderComponent.class.getClassLoader())),
        resourceBundleLoader);
    }

The `@Reference` annotation targets the original Blogs module by specifying
its symbolic name `com.liferay.blogs.web`. This sample's own component name
(i.e., `com.liferay.blade.samples.hook.resourcebundle.ResourceBundleLoaderComponent`)
is not targeted to use this resource bundle.

Also note the required parameters to set the resource bundle loader:

- The base language file name (e.g., `content.Language`).
- The classloader for your resource bundle loader.
- The resource bundle loader from the method's parameter.

The class should also register the resource bundle loader in the OSGi runtime.
This is done by setting the following three properties:

- `bundle.symbolic.name`: The symbolic name of the target module (i.e., the
	module's keys you're overriding).
- `resource.bundle.base.name`: The resource bundle base name that points to
  your language files.
- `servlet.context.name`: The servlet context name of the target module.

These properties are set in your class's `@Component` annotation like this:

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        property = {
            "bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web",
            "resource.bundle.base.name=content.Language",
            "servlet.context.name=blogs-web"
        }
    )

Lastly, the new `language.properties` files should be added to the folder
`src/content` for each locale's keys you want to override. Since this
example's goal is to only override the English and Spanish keys, the
`Language_en.properties` and `Language_es.properties` are added.

This approach can be used to override any application's language keys (i.e.,
`language.properties` files that are inside a module deployed to Portal's OSGi
runtime). If you need to override Portal's core language keys, see the
