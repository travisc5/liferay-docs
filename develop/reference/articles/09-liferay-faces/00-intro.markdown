# Liferay Faces [](id=liferay-faces)

Liferay Faces is an umbrella project that provides support for the
JavaServer&#8482; Faces (JSF) standard within Liferay Portal. It encompasses the
following projects:

- **Liferay Faces Bridge** enables you to deploy JSF web apps as portlets
without writing portlet-specific Java code. It also contains innovative features
that make it possible to leverage the power of JSF 2.x inside a portlet
application. Liferay Faces Bridge implements the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge
Standard. 
- **Liferay Faces Alloy** enables you to use AlloyUI components in a way that
is consistent with JSF development. 
- **Liferay Faces Portal** enables you to leverage Liferay-specific utilities
and UI components in JSF portlets. 

In this section of reference documentation, you'll learn more about each of
these projects. You'll also learn about the Liferay Faces version scheme.
