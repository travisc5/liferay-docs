login for future sessions. The Screenlet also supports navigation of form fields
from the keyboard of the user's device.

For more details, please refer to the 
[Setting up a Liferay Instance](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/setting-up-a-liferay-instance) 
section of the User Guide. 

## Anonymous Request [](id=anonymous-request)

Anonymous requests are unauthenticated requests. Authentication is needed,
however, to call the API. To allow this operation, the portal administrator
should create a specific user with minimal permissions.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet doesn't support offline mode. It requires network connectivity.

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `anonymousApiUserName` | `string` | The user name, email address, or user ID (depending on the portal's authentication method) to use for authenticating the request. |
| `anoymousApiPassword` | `string` | The password for use in authenticating the request. |
| `companyId` | `number` | When set, authentication is done for a user in the specified company. If the value is `0`, the company specified in `LiferayServerContext` is used. |
| `autoLogin` | `boolean` | Whether the user is logged in automatically after a successful sign up. |
| `saveCredentials` | `boolean` | Sets whether or not the user's credentials and attributes are stored in the keychain after a successful log in. This attribute is ignored if `autologin` is disabled. |

## Delegate [](id=delegate)

The Sign Up Screenlet delegates some events to an object that conforms to the 
`SignUpScreenletDelegate` protocol. If the `autologin` attribute is enabled, 
login events are delegated to an object conforming to the 
`LoginScreenletDelegate` protocol. Refer to the [`LoginScreenlet` documentation](LoginScreenlet.md) 
for more details.

The `SignUpScreenletDelegate` protocol lets you implement the following methods:

- `- screenlet:onSignUpResponseUserAttributes:`: Called when sign up 
  successfully completes. The user attributes are passed as a dictionary of keys 
  (`String` or `NSStrings`) and values (`AnyObject` or `NSObject`). The 
  supported keys are the same as [Liferay Portal's User entity](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service.xml#L2227).

- `- screenlet:onSignUpError:`: Called when an error occurs in the process. The 
  `NSError` object describes the error.
