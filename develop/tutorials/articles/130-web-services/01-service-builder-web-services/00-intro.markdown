Liferay apps. 
[The section of tutorials on Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/what-is-service-builder) 
gives a general introduction to Service Builder, as well as instructions on 
generating your app's local services. But what if you want to use Service 
Builder to generate your app's remote services? And how should you invoke remote 
services generated by Service Builder? No sweat! That's exactly what the 
tutorials here cover. This section shows you how to use Service Builder to
