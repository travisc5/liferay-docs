# Using the WAB Generator [](id=using-the-wab-generator)

Developers creating applications for @product-ver@ can choose to create them as
Java EE-style Web Application ARchive (WAR) artifacts or as Java ARchive (JAR)
OSGi bundle artifacts. Some plugin developers, however, don't have that
flexibility. Portlets like Spring MVC and JSF must be packaged as WAR artifacts
because their frameworks are designed for Java EE. Therefore, they expect a WAR
layout and require Java EE resources such as the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor.

Liferay provides a way for these WAR-styled plugins to be deployed and treated
like OSGi modules by Liferay's OSGi runtime. They can be converted to *WAB*s.

@product-ver@ supports the OSGi Web Application Bundle (WAB) standard for
deployment of Java EE style WARs. Simply put, a WAB is an archive that has a WAR
layout and contains a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file with the `Bundle-SymbolicName`
OSGi directive. A WAB is an OSGi bundle. Although the source of the project has
a WAR layout, the artifact filename may end with either the `.jar` or `.war`
extension.

Liferay only supports the use of WABs that have been auto-generated by the WAB
Generator. The WAB Generator transforms a general WAR-style plugin into a WAB
during its deployment process. So what exactly does the WAB Generator do to a
WAR file to transform it into a WAB?

The WAB Generator detects packages a plugin's JSPs and descriptor files
reference. The descriptor files include `web.xml`, `liferay-web.xml`,
`portlet.xml`, `liferay-portlet.xml`, and `liferay-hook.xml`. The WAB Generator
verifies whether the detected packages are in the plugin's `WEB-INF/classes`
folder or in a JAR file in the plugin's `WEB-INF/lib` folder. Packages that
aren't found in either location are added to an `Import-Package` header in the
WAB's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file. 

The WAB folder structure and WAR folder structure differ. Consider the following
folder structure of a WAR-style portlet:

    - my-war-portlet
        - src
            - main
                - java
                - webapp
                    - WEB-INF
                        - resources
                        - views
                        - faces-config.xml
                        - liferay-display.xml
                        - liferay-plugin-package.properties
                        - liferay-portlet.xml
                        - portlet.xml
                        - web.xml

When a WAR-style portlet is deployed to @product@ and processed by the WAB
Generator, the portlet's folder structure is transformed to something like this

    - my-war-portlet-that-is-now-a-wab
        - META-INF
            - MANIFEST.MF
        - WEB-INF
            - classes
            - lib
            - resources
            - views
            - faces-config.xml
            - liferay-display.xml
            - liferay-plugin-package.properties
            - liferay-portlet.xml
            - portlet.xml
            - web.xml

The major difference is the addition of the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file. The WAB
Generator automatically generates an OSGi-ready `MANIFEST.MF` file. If you want
to affect the content of the manifest file, you can place BND directives and
OSGi headers directly into the `WEB-INF/liferay-plugin-package.properties` file.
A `bnd.bnd` and/or a build-time plugin (e.g., `bnd-maven-plugin`) should not be
provided for your WAR plugin, because the generated WAB cannot make use of them.

Do you want to try this out for yourself? Follow the steps below to see the WAB
Generator in action.

1.  Create a WAR-style plugin that follows a similar structure to the one
    outlined above. You can download an example WAR-style portlet
    [here](https://dev.liferay.com/documents/10184/656312/com.liferay.hello.user.jsf.portlet-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war/640837a9-9437-47a8-af42-8d406d93e7a2?download=true),
    for demonstration.

    <!-- Attach WAR above for download. -Cody -->

2.  Open your @product@ instance in a file explorer and add a
    `portal-ext.properties` file with the following properties:

        module.framework.web.generator.generated.wabs.store=true
        module.framework.web.generator.generated.wabs.store.dir=${module.framework.base.dir}/wabs

    These properties store your generated WAB into your @product@ instance's
    `osgi/wabs` folder. You can learn more about these properties in the
    [Module Framework Web Application Bundles](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Module%20Framework%20Web%20Application%20Bundles)
    properties section. Restart @product@ for these changes to be recognized.

3.  Copy your WAR plugin in your @product@ instance's `deploy` folder.

4.  Navigate to your @product@ instance's `osgi/wabs` folder and inspect the
    generated WAB.

Awesome! You've seen the WAB Generator in action!
