# Social [](id=social)

@product@'s social framework lets users provide feedback on content, share that
content with others across social networks, and subscribe to notifications on
content, so they can stay up to date on the latest and greatest that you have to
share. 

The tutorials that follow show you how to take advantage of @product@'s social 
framework to enable these features in your own app.
