# Data Upgrades [](id=data-upgrades-and-verifiers)

Your module goes through various stages of development, because you're
constantly trying to improve it. You add new features, remove features, enhance
features, reorganize the code, and do whatever you can to respond to what your
users want and make your module the best it can be. To transition users to new
and improved versions of your module, you need to take them through the process
of upgrading. 

Liferay provides a robust data upgrade framework for you to use. Here you'll
learn how to create a data upgrade process.
