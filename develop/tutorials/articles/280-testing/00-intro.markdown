# Testing [](id=testing)

[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org) is an extensible Java testing platform that's
designed to make integration testing easy. Arquillian manages the lifecycle of
setting up, starting, or connecting to a container (e.g., Tomcat), packaging
your test cases and any dependent classes or resources, deploying them to the
container, running the tests in the container, and capturing and reporting the
results. The
[Arquillian Extension for Liferay](https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-liferay)
is a set of tools designed to help developers test their Liferay plugins.
The [Arquillian Extension Liferay Example](https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-liferay/blob/master/arquillian-extension-liferay-example)
project demonstrates how to use the Arquillian Liferay Extension.
