# Arquillian Extension for Liferay Example [](id=arquillian-extension-for-liferay-example)

The
[Arquillian Blade Example project](https://github.com/liferay-labs/arquillian-blade-example)
demonstrates performing integration and functional tests using the
[Arquillian Liferay Extension](https://github.com/liferay-labs/arquillian-liferay).
Additionally it measures code coverage using
[JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/).
In this tutorial, you'll learn how the Arquillian Liferay Extension and JaCoCo
work. You can download the Arquillian Blade Example project
