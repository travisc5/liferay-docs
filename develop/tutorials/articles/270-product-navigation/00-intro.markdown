# Product Navigation [](id=product-navigation)

Liferay's product navigation consists of the main menus you use to customize,
configure, and navigate your Liferay instance. Whether you edit a page, switch
to a different site scope, access a user's credentials, etc., you're constantly
using the default navigation menus. Liferay's product navigation is designed to
be intuitive and extensive, but often times, providing a customization to a
default menu is necessary to give your Liferay instance that unique touch you're
searching for. Liferay allows developers to extend and customize the default
product navigation to fit their needs.

There are four main sections of Liferay's product navigation that you can
extend: Product Menu, Control Menu, Simulation Menu, and User Personal Bar.

As you can see from the figure above, the Product Menu is the menu to the left
that displays your's instance's Control Panel, user account settings, and Site
Administration functionality. The Control Menu is the top menu offering
navigation to the Product Menu, Simulation Menu (the right menu), and *Add*
button. When certain settings are enabled (e.g., Staging, Page Customization,
etc.) more tools are offered. The Simulation Menu offers options to simulate
your site's look for different scenarios (devices, user segments, etc.). Lastly,
the User Peronsal Bar is used to hold selectable items that aid with a user's 
own account settings.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn about the various ways you can extend
and customize Liferay's product navigation to fit your needs.
