# Optimizing Plugins for @product-ver@ [](id=optimizing-plugins-for-liferay-7)

Once you've [upgraded your plugin](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/upgrading-plugins-to-liferay-7)
to @product-ver@, you can optimize it to take advantage of all @product-ver@
offers. If you haven't yet familiarized yourself with
[what's changed from Liferay Portal 6](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/whats-changed-and-what-hasnt),
the
[new benefits for developers](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/benefits-of-liferay-7-for-liferay-6-developers),
[OSGi and modularity](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers),
and the
[improved tooling](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/improved-developer-tooling-liferay-workspace-maven-plugins-and-more),
make sure to do so as they'll help you understand and appreciate the optional
improvements for plugins and plugin development the optimization tutorials
demonstrate. 

Here are some common optimizations to consider:

-   Migrating to environments that help you develop and test
    more quickly, such as the
    [Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/migrating-a-6-2-theme-to-liferay-7)
    for themes and
    [Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/improved-developer-tooling-liferay-workspace-maven-plugins-and-more#from-the-plugins-sdk-to-liferay-workspace)
    for modules and web applications. 
-   Adapting plugins to [@product-ver@'s modular architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/whats-changed-and-what-hasnt#embracing-a-modular-architecture)
    and updated frameworks, such as Service Builder.
-   [Styling your app consistently using Clay](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)
    --the web implementation of Liferay's Lexicon design language standards.
-   Modularizing apps to reap the
    [benefits of modularity](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers#modules-as-an-improvement-over-traditional-plugins)
    and all that @product-ver@ offers. 

Several optimization tutorials are here and more are coming soon.
