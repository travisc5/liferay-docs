# Android Apps with Liferay Screens [](id=android-apps-with-liferay-screens)

Liferay Screens speeds up and simplifies developing native mobile apps that use
Liferay. Its power lies in its *Screenlets*. A Screenlet is a visual component
that you insert into your native app to leverage Liferay Portal's content and
[services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/invoking-remote-services). On
Android, Screenlets are available to log in to your portal, create accounts, 
submit forms, display content, and more. You can use any number of Screenlets in 
your app; they're independent, so you can use them in modular fashion. 
Screenlets on Android also deliver UI flexibility with pluggable *Views* that 
implement elegant user interfaces. Liferay's reference documentation for
[Android](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/screenlets-in-liferay-screens-for-android) 
Screenlets describes each Screenlet's features and Views. 

You might be thinking, "These Screenlets sound like the greatest thing since
taco Tuesdays, but what if they don't fit in with my app's UI? What if they
don't behave exactly how I want them to? What if there's no Screenlet for what I
want to do?" Fret not! You can customize Screenlets to fit your needs by
changing or extending their UI and behavior. You can even write your own
Screenlets! What's more, Screens seamlessly integrates with your existing 
Android projects.

Screenlets leverage the
[Liferay Mobile SDK](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk/overview)
to make server calls. The Mobile SDK is a low-level layer on top of the Liferay
JSON API. To write your own Screenlets, you must familiarize yourself with
Liferay's
[remote services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/invoking-remote-services).
If no existing Screenlet meets your needs, consider customizing an existing
Screenlet, creating a Screenlet, or directly using the Mobile SDK. Creating a
Screenlet involves writing Mobile SDK calls and constructing the Screenlet; if
you don't plan to reuse or distribute the implementation then you may want to
forgo writing a Screenlet and, instead, work with the
[Mobile SDK](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mobile-sdk). A benefit of
integrating an existing Screenlet into your app, however, is that the Mobile
SDK's details are abstracted from you. 

These tutorials show you how to use, customize, create, and distribute
Screenlets for Android. They show you how to create Views too. There's even a 
tutorial that explains the nitty-gritty details of the Liferay Screens 
architecture. No matter how deep you want to go, you'll use Screenlets in no 
time. Start by preparing your
[Android project](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/preparing-android-projects-for-liferay-screens)
to use Liferay Screens.
