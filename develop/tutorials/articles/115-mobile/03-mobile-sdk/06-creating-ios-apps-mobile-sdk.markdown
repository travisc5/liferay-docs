# Creating iOS Apps that Use the Mobile SDK [](id=creating-ios-apps-that-use-the-mobile-sdk)

The Liferay Mobile SDK provides a way to streamline consuming Liferay core web 
services, Liferay utilities, and custom portlet web services. It wraps Liferay
JSON web services, making them easy to call in native mobile apps. It takes care
of authentication, makes HTTP requests (synchronously or asynchronously), parses
JSON results, and handles server-side exceptions so you can concentrate on
*using* the services in your app. 

The Liferay Mobile SDK comes with the Liferay iOS SDK and is ready for you to 
download and use. The official 
[project page](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk/overview)
gives you access to the SDK releases, provides the latest SDK news, and has
forums for you to engage in mobile app development discussions.

The Liferay iOS SDK bridges your native app with Liferay services. Once you've 
installed and configured the Liferay iOS SDK, you can invoke Liferay services 
from your app. 

The iOS app development tutorials include the following topics: 

- Making Liferay and Custom Portlet Services Available in Your iOS App
- Invoking Liferay Services in Your iOS App
- Invoking Services Asynchronously from Your iOS App
- Sending Your iOS App's Requests Using Batch Processing

You can get started by making Liferay services available to your app. This is 
accomplished by installing the iOS SDK.
