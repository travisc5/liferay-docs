class="table-header left-header" > App Name </td> <td class="" > This is
probably the most important branding element of your app, so be creative! Some
important things to keep in mind: <ul> <li>In some views within the Marketplace,
titles of applications longer than 18 characters will be shortened with
ellipsis.</li> <li>Titles must not be longer than 50 characters.</li> <li>App
title may contain the word "Liferay" to describe its use or intent as long as
the name does not imply official certification or validation from Liferay, Inc.
(For example, names such as "Exchange Connector for Liferay" or "Integration
Connector Kit for Liferay" would be allowed, while "Liferay Mail Portlet,"
"Liferay Management Console," or "Liferay UI Kit" would not be permissible
without explicit approval). Please refer to our <a href
="https://www.liferay.com/trademark">trademark policy</a> for details. </li>
<li>Please try to conform the app name, as closely as possible, to the actual
plugin (portlet, hook, theme, etc.) name</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td
class="table-header left-header" > Support Information </td> <td class="" >
<p>Please include an email address, contact information, and/or website URL for
the "Support" field. If someone encounters an issue with your app, they will
need a way to contact you. <p>Even if you choose not to offer Support Services
(by unchecking "Offer Support" during the app submission process), we require
that you provide support contact information so that buyers can reach you with
general questions about your app. </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="table-header
left-header" > Description </td> <td class="" > Please provide a description for
your app in English. At a minimum, the description should provide a concise
overview of what the app does. Great descriptions also list key functionalities
and what customers can expect to gain by deploying your app. If you'd like to
see an example, you can check out our description of <a
href="/marketplace/-/mp/application/18535553?_7_WAR_osbportlet_backURL=%2Fmarketplace%3F_11_WAR_osbportlet_formDate%3D1390412780112%26p_p_id%3D7_WAR_osbportlet%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_pos%3D1%26p_p_col_count%3D4%26_7_WAR_osbportlet_mvcPath%3D%252Fmarketplace%252Fsearch.jsp%26p_r_p_564233524_assetCategoryId%3D0%26p_r_p_564233524_keywords%3Dsocial%2Boffice">Social
Office</a>. <p> It's important that you specify any plugin dependencies (eg.,
plugins that must be installed prior to running your app) and environment
compatibilities (eg., compatibility with specific app servers) here, so that
both potential buyers and the Liferay app review team will be aware of these
requirements. </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="table-header left-header" >
Compatibility with Future Minor Releases of Liferay Portal </td> <td class="" >
Please include a "+" at the end of the latest version when specifying version
constraints in your liferay-plugin-package.properties file (eg.,
"liferay-versions=6.1.1+, 6.1.20+"). This will ensure that your app will
continue to be deployable to future versions of Liferay within a minor release.
If, in the future, you discover your app does NOT work with a particular Liferay
version, you can modify the list to exclude that version. </td> </tr> <tr> <td
class="table-header left-header" > Increase Your Potential User Base </td> <td
class="" > In most cases, an app that is compatible with CE portal will also run
under EE portal, and vice versa. Specifying compatibility with both EE and CE
versions of the portal will ensure that a wider audience has access to your app!
<p>You can <a href="/web/developer/marketplace/license">request a Liferay EE
Developer License</a> to support testing and confirm compatibility.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr> <td class="table-header left-header" > Icon </td> <td class="" >
Icons for your app must be exactly 90 pixels in both height and width and must
be in PNG, JPG, or GIF format. The image size cannot exceed 512kb. Animated
images are prohibited. <p>The use of the Liferay logo, including any permitted
alternate versions of the Liferay logo, is permitted only with Liferay's
explicit approval. Please refer to our <a href
="https://www.liferay.com/trademark">trademark policy</a> for details.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr> <td class="table-header left-header" > Screenshots </td> <td class=""
> Screenshots for your app must not exceed 1080 pixels in width x 678 pixels in
height and must be in the JPG format. The file size of each screenshot must not
exceed 384KB. Each screenshot should preferably be the same size (each will be
automatically scaled to match the aspect ratio of the above dimensions), and it
is preferable if they are named sequentially, for example fluffy-puppies-01.png,
fluffy-puppies-02.png, and so on. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div>
